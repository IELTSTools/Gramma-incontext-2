                                      My parents immigrated to the United States from Poland and learned English as a
                                  second language as adults. My sisters and I were born in the United States. My parents
                                  spoke Yiddish to us; we answered in English. In that process, my parents’ English improved
                                  immeasurably. Such is the case with many immigrant parents whose children are fluent
                                  in English. They usually learn English much faster than others; they hear the language in
                                  natural ways, in the context of daily life.
                                      Learning a language in context, whether it be from the home, from work, or from a
                                  textbook, cannot be overestimated. The challenge for me has been to find a variety of
                                  high-interest topics to engage the adult language learner. I was thrilled to work on this new
                                  edition of Grammar in Context for National Geographic Learning. In so doing, I have been
                                  able to combine exciting new readings with captivating photos to exemplify the grammar.
                                      I have given more than 100 workshops at ESL programs and professional conferences
                                  around the United States, where I have gotten feedback from users of previous editions
                                  of Grammar in Context. Some teachers have expressed concern about trying to cover long
                                  grammar units within a limited time. While ESL is not taught in a uniform number of hours
                                  per week, I have heeded my audiences and streamlined the series so that the grammar and
                                  practice covered is more manageable. And in response to the needs of most ESL programs,
                                  I have expanded and enriched the writing component.
                                      Whether you are a new user of Grammar in Context or have used this series before, I
                                  welcome you to this new edition.

           EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION
           The dog owner is not home now.                    To make a negative statement with be, we put not after a
           She isn’t home during the day.                    form of be. The negative contractions are isn’t and aren’t.
           You are not ready for a pet.
           You aren’t patient.

           We can make contractions in negative statements with most subject pronouns + a form of be or
           with a form of be + not. (Exception: I am not)
           I am not                                          I’m not                     —

           he is not                                         he’s not        or        he isn’t
           she is not                                        she’s not       or        she isn’t
           it is not                                         it’s not        or        it isn’t
           we are not                                        we’re not       or        we aren’t
           they are not                                      they’re not     or        they aren’t
           Notes:
           1.  We can make contractions with most nouns:
                  The dog is not friendly. = The dog’s not friendly. = The dog isn’t friendly.
           2.  Remember: We cannot make a contraction with certain words + is. (See 1.2.)
                  This is not a good pet. = This isn’t a good pet. (not: This’s not)

               B:  She writes about animals in danger.           end of the wh- question.
               A:  What are these animals in danger of?
               B:  They’re in danger of disappearing.
               A:  Where does Lucy Cooke come from?              For place of origin, we use be from or come from.
               B:  She comes from England.
               A:  Where is she from?
               B:  She’s from England.

               B:  It begins at 9 p.m.



                GRAMMAR IN USE
                Putting the preposition before a question word is grammatically correct, but very formal. When the preposition
                comes at the beginning, we use whom, not who. This formal style is rarely used in everyday speech.
                      Formal: With whom does the dog play?
                      InFormal: Who does the dog play with?

                           Bottlenose dolphins are very popular animals. We often see them in aquariums, sea parks,
                        TV shows, and movies. Because of the shape of their nose, they look like they always have a
                        smile on their faces.

                           Bottlenose dolphins live in warm climates. They live underwater, but they rarely stay there
                        for more than seven minutes. Humans are involuntary  breathers. We don’t usually think
                                                                        1
                        about breathing. But dolphins have to remember to breathe. One side of their brain is always
                        active. This means they never fully sleep.
                           Dolphins have an excellent sense of hearing. They use clicking sounds to find food. The

                        sound echoes  back and tells them where the food is.
                           Bottlenose dolphins are social animals. They usually swim in groups of 10 to 15. Together
                        they hunt  for food. They sometimes hunt with fishermen near their fishing boats. Once in

                        a while a dolphin hunts alone. Sometimes a dolphin gets lost. Each dolphin has a unique
                        whistle, so it uses its whistle to call out to the group.
                           Bottlenose dolphins usually live about 40 to 50 years.

               WRITING TIP
               When you write about an animal, introduce it by making a statement with be + an adjective to describe it:
                   The zebra is a social animal.
               When you write about the animal’s behavior, use the simple present. Choose the correct form:
                   A zebra runs very quickly./Zebras live in grasslands.
               To describe animal behavior, use frequency words and expressions:
                   Zebras often move around to find fresh grass.


              PART 3  Write
              Read the prompts. Choose one and write a paragraph about it.

              1.  Look for a Lucy Cooke video online. Watch the video and describe the behavior of the animal.
                 What does this video teach you about the animal? (Provide your teacher with a link to the video.)
              2.  Describe the behavior of an animal you know about. This can be a pet or a wild animal.

           STILL GOING STRONG









           Read the following article. Pay special attention to the words in bold.   2.1

              Many people in the United States retire in their sixties, but
           not fashion icon  Iris Apfel. Born in 1921 in New York City,
                         1
           Apfel is now in her late nineties. But unlike many people her
           age, she isn’t relaxing at home. Instead, she is creating a new
           line of clothing and jewelry. She’s planning a fashion show,
           too. And she’s traveling all over the world. “I’m working
           harder than ever,” she says, “but I’m having so much fun.”
                                                       2
              For many years, Apfel was an interior designer . Now
           she’s working in fashion. Her style is unique. She’s
           always wearing colorful clothing, jewelry, and large
           black glasses. On the street, people are constantly
                      3
           approaching  her and taking her photo.
              On Instagram, Apfel has over a million
           followers, but she is worried about social media.
           She thinks it’s ruining fashion. People are copying
           each other, Apfel says. Everything is becoming the
           same everywhere—in New York, Hong Kong, Paris.
           It’s boring, Apfel believes. When things are different,
           then they are interesting.
              Don’t follow others, Apfel tells people. “Be your own
           person”—in fashion and in life. Ask yourself: “Am I doing
           the right thing for me?” This can be about your clothing
           choices, or even the subject you’re studying in school. Apfel               Iris Apfel’s style is
           lives her life this way. And at almost one hundred years old,               unique. Here, she
                                                                                       is wearing black
           she is still going strong.                                                  and white with red
                                                                                       accessories, and, as
                                                                                       always, her famous

               1.       Iris Apfel is in her sixties, and she is planning to retire soon.
               2.       A lot of people like Iris Apfel’s style.

               3.       Iris Apfel likes social media. In her opinion, it is improving fashion.

              THINK ABOUT IT  Discuss the questions with a partner or in a small group.

               1.  The last sentence of the reading says that Iris Apfel “is still going strong.” What does the expression “still
                 going strong” mean? Why does this expression describe Ms. Apfel?
               2. Do you think it’s a good idea for people to work into their sixties and beyond? Why or why not?


              2.1  The Present Continuous—Form

              For the present continuous, we use a form of be (am, is, are) + verb + –ing.

               SUBJECT                  BE (AM, IS, ARE)         VERB + -ING
               I                        am                       working                  hard.
               Iris/She                 is                       traveling                all over the world.

               Social media/It          is                       ruining                  fashion.
               Some people/They         are                      taking                   Ms. Apfel’s photo.
               You                      are                      learning                 about Iris Apfel.
               Notes:
               1. We can make a contraction with the subject pronoun and a form of be. Most nouns can also
                  contract with is.
                     I’m having so much fun.
                     She’s traveling all over the world.
                     Iris Apfel’s creating a new clothing line. Her team’s helping her.
               2. To form the negative, we put not after am/is/are. In many cases, we can make a negative
                  contraction in two ways:
                      She is not relaxing. = She isn’t relaxing. = She’s not relaxing.
                      You are not working. = You aren’t working. = You’re not working.
               3. For I am not, there is only one contraction:
                      I am not traveling. = I’m not traveling.
               4. We do not repeat the be verb after and or or.
                       She is traveling and planning a fashion show.
               5. We can put an adverb between be and the verb + –ing.
                       She’s still going strong.
               6. The present continuous is also called the present progressive.

           2.6  The Future with Will


           EXAMPLES                                         EXPLANATION
           The number of older people will increase in the future.  We use will + the base form for the future.
           My grandfather will be 85 next week.
           I’ll be 72 years old in 2050.                    We can contract will with the subject pronouns. The
           We’ll retire at age 65.                          contractions are I’ll, you’ll, he’ll, she’ll, it’ll, we’ll, and they’ll.
           The population will not decrease.                To form the negative, we put not after will. The
           I won’t retire soon.                             contraction for will not is won’t.
           You’ll probably have a long retirement.          We can put an adverb between will and the main verb.

           Compare statements, yes/no questions, short answers, and wh- questions.

                                       YES/NO QUESTION
           STATEMENT                                                    WH- QUESTION
                                       AND SHORT ANSWER
           She will help her parents.  Will she help her parents?       How will she help her parents?
                                       Yes, she will.
           You will retire soon.       Will you retire next year?       When will you retire?
                                       No, I won’t.
           There won’t be enough       Will there be a lot of jobs?     Why won’t there be enough health
           health workers.             Yes, there will.                 workers?

           SIMPLE PRESENT
           For general truths                                Many people retire in their sixties.
                                                             Most young people have smart phones.
           For regular activities, habits, customs           Jack plays golf twice a week.
                                                             I always visit my grandparents on the weekend.
           With a place of origin                            My grandfather comes from Mexico.
                                                             My grandmother comes from Peru.

           future statement                                  If Grandma needs help, she’ll live with us.

           With nonaction verbs                              I care about my grandparents.
                                                             Your grandfather needs help now.
                                                             My grandfather prefers to live alone now.
           For scheduled events                              The plane leaves at 8 p.m. tonight.



           PRESENT CONTINUOUS (WITH ACTION VERBS ONLY)
           For an action happening now, at this moment       My friend is texting me now.
                                                             She’s sending me her photo.

           For a trend in society                            The population of the U.S. is getting older.
                                                             Americans are living longer.
           For a definite plan in the near future            She is retiring next month.
                                                             She is going on a long trip soon.
           With a descriptive state                          Mary is standing over there.
                                                             She is wearing jeans and a T-shirt.

               WRITING TIP
               When you write, it’s important to think about the verb forms you need to express your ideas.
               If you choose prompt 1 below, you might start with a general statement such as “My generation uses more
               technology than my parents’ generation.” If your supporting examples are of past events, use the simple past. If
               your examples are of habitual or general actions, use the simple present.
               For prompt 2, decide which verb forms are necessary to ask someone questions about current activities and about
               plans for the future.
                      habitual actions: “How do you spend your time?”
                      future plans: “What are you looking forward to?”
               Remember that there are various future forms, depending on the context.


              PART 3  Write
              Read the prompts. Choose one and write a paragraph about it.

              1.  Write about the differences in generations and their use of technology. Use examples from your
                 own life or the lives of people you know.
              2.  Interview a retired person. What is this person doing with his or her life now? What are this
                 person’s plans for the future?

           and           SUCCESS









           Read the following article. Pay special attention to the words in bold.   3.1

              What is success? What do we learn from failure ? When we try something new, failure is
                                                       1
           always a possibility. In the nineteenth century, many explorers attempted to reach the North
           Pole by land, but they died trying. Salomon Andrée was a Swedish engineer. He wanted to be
           the first person to arrive at the North Pole. He knew that travel over land was very dangerous.
           He had an idea. He thought he had the perfect way to reach the North Pole: by balloon. On a
           windy day in July 1897, Andrée and two other men climbed into the basket of a balloon. They
           took with them enough food for several months. When they left, people cheered and waved.

                                                                  2
              As soon as they lifted off, strong winds hit the balloon. Fog  froze on it, making it too
           heavy. The men traveled by balloon for 65 hours. Were they successful? Did they arrive
           safely? Unfortunately, no. They landed almost three hundred miles from the North Pole. No
           one heard from them again. Thirty-three years later, hunters found their frozen bodies, their
           cameras, and their diaries.
              Failure is part of all exploration. Robert Ballard, a famous ocean explorer, says that
           success and failure go together. Failure helps us do things differently the next time.
           Mountain climber Peter Athans said, “I learned how not to climb the first
                                   3
           four times I tried to summit  Everest.”
              In 1914, a polar explorer, Ernest Shackleton, led an expedition
           across Antarctica. His ship became trapped in the ice.
           However, he brought the 27 men on his team home safely.
           The expedition was a failure, but the rescue of his men
           was a success.
              Failure helps us on our next try. Failure is a
           good teacher. Without failure, success would be
           impossible.


           1   failure: an activity or project that does not succeed
           2    fog: a heavy gray vapor near the ground that
            makes it difficult to see
           3   to summit: to reach the top of a mountain
                                                                              Salomon Andrée and Knut Fraenkel look
                                                                              at their balloon after it crashed on ice. The
                                                                              photograph was taken by the third team
                                                                              member, Nils Strindberg.

               1.       Salomon Andrée was the first person to reach the North Pole.
               2.       The weather caused problems with the balloon.

               3.       Robert Ballard successfully climbed Mt. Everest.

              THINK ABOUT IT  Discuss the questions with a partner or in a small group.

               1.   What did Peter Athans mean when he said, “I learned how not to climb the first four times I tried to summit
                 Everest.”? Do you think he eventually climbed Everest?
               2.   Do you agree that without failure, success would be impossible? Do you have any examples from your life of
                 failing at something before eventually succeeding?

                GRAMMAR IN USE
                A common error in speaking is to add a syllable to simple past verbs that end in a consonant. Remember—only
                the consonant sounds /d/ and /t/ add a syllable in the -ed form.

                   waited = /we -t d/   started = /stαr-t d/
                              y
                   lived = /l  vd/    not: /l -v d/

                   FUN WITH GRAMMAR

             Play Alibi. Your teacher will tell you the time and place of a robbery. Two students are the suspects and leave
             the room. As a class, think of questions to ask the suspects, e.g., Where were you at the time of the robbery? Who
             was with you? The two suspects create an alibi (proof that they were not at the scene of the crime at the time it
             took place) together. They should try to anticipate what questions the class will ask them and think of answers.
             Then the class will interview the suspects one at a time. If their answers match, they are innocent. If their
             answers don’t match, they are guilty.
                    Class: Where were you at the time of the robbery?
                    Suspect 1: I was at the Mexican restaurant down the street. Suspect 2 was with me.
                    Class: What time did you leave the restaurant?
                    Suspect 1: We left at around 9:30.

               WRITING TIP
               When writing about someone’s life story, we use simple past forms. We often begin with information about when
               and where a person was born. Then it is common to provide details of his or her life chronologically; for example,
               the person’s childhood, schooling, accomplishments, etc., in the simple past. Question forms may be used to bring
               attention to a particular detail, for example Was George Lawson a success? He definitely was.



              PART 3  Write
              Read the prompts. Choose one and write a paragraph about it.

              1.  Write about an ordinary person who did something extraordinary (like George Dawson). It can be
                 someone you read about or someone you know.
              2.  Write about a time when you failed at something. What did you learn from your failure?

              PART 4  Edit
              Reread the Summary of Unit 3 and the editing advice. Edit your writing from Part 3.

               (bride’s = bride’s parents)                       avoid repetition.

              4.6  Object Pronouns


              The object pronouns are me, you, him, her, it, us, and them.

               EXAMPLES                                           EXPLANATION
               “I love you,” Josh said.                           We use object pronouns after a verb.
               We saw the wedding photos. We liked them.
               Did Emily’s parents pay for the wedding?           An object pronoun can follow a preposition (at, with,
               No, Josh and Emily paid for it.                    of, about, to, from, in, etc.).

               He invited my family and me to the wedding.        Be careful with subjects and objects connected with
               My family and I went to the wedding.               and. After a verb, we use an object pronoun. Before a
                                                                  verb, we use a subject pronoun.
               Notes:
               1.  An object can be direct or indirect.
                      I love you. (A direct object receives the action of the verb.)
                        Emily showed me the wedding photos. (An indirect object answers to whom or for whom, in this case, “Who did
                     Emily show the wedding photos to?”)
               2.  We can use them for plural people and things.
                      Emily met Josh’s sisters, and she liked them.
                      These are the wedding photos. Let’s look at them.
               3.  Compare subject pronouns (in the first column) and object pronouns (in the last column):

                   I                                              me.

                  During their meeting, the counselor said, “Emily, you spend your weekends doing

              housework. Can Josh help                  ?”
                                             12.
                  “Emily doesn’t want                  to help,” Josh replied.

           Read the following article. Pay special attention to the
           words in bold.   4.4

              Wedding traditions are changing. More and more couples are
           choosing to create a unique wedding experience for themselves
                                                               1
           and for their guests. In traditional weddings, a clergyperson
           faces the bride and groom and reads them their vows. The           An African-American couple
                                                                              jumps over a broom.
           bride and groom simply say, “I do” in response to the question
           of whether or not they agree to marry. But today, 43 percent of
           weddings are officiated by a friend or family member rather than
           a clergyperson. And more and more couples are writing their
           own vows and saying them to each other in their own words.

              Following tradition, the bride and groom send their friends
           and relatives an invitation. But with today’s busy schedules,
           the new norm is for the bride and groom to tell their
           guests the date at least five or six months in advance.
           They send them “save-the-date” cards so that their
           guests can make plans. Some couples are choosing to
           have a themed wedding—a central idea or style for their
           big day. Examples include a specific decade, a movie or
           television show, a book, a city, or a color. The cards give this
           information to guests so that they can dress appropriately.

              Another new trend in weddings is to create a wedding
           based on the couple’s ethnic background. For
           example, in an African-American wedding, some
                                                   2
           couples want to show respect to their ancestors
           by jumping over a broom, a tradition from the
           time of slavery. The jumping of the broom
           symbolizes a new beginning by sweeping away
           the old and welcoming the new. Some African
           Americans use colorful clothing inspired by
           African costumes, rather than a white dress for
           the bride and a suit or tuxedo for the groom.

              One thing stays the same. The newlyweds send
           the guests thank-you cards by mail to thank them for
           attending the wedding and for the gifts they gave.



           1   clergyperson: a minister, rabbi, or other religious leader
           2    ancestor: the people from whom one is descended;
            great-grandparent, great-great-grandparent, etc.

               1.       More couples are choosing to have unique weddings.
               2.       Both the couple and the guests need time to plan for a wedding.

               3.       Jumping over a broom is part of some ethnic weddings.

              THINK ABOUT IT  Discuss the questions with a partner or in a small group.

               1.   Do you like the idea of modern weddings with an unusual theme, or do you prefer a more traditional
                 celebration? Why?
               2.   What ethnic traditions have you seen in weddings? Which traditions would you like to have or did you have,
                 at your wedding?


              4.8  Direct and Indirect Objects

              Some verbs can have both a direct and an indirect object. The order of direct objects (DO)
              and indirect objects (IO) depends on the verb we use. With some verbs, it can also depend
              on whether we use a noun or a pronoun as the object.
              With some verbs, pronouns affect word order.

               POSSIBLE WORD ORDER                                VERBS
               He gave his wife a present. (IO/DO)                bring       hand        read         show
               He gave a present to his wife. (DO to IO)          email       offer       sell         tell
               He gave it to his wife. (DO to IO)                 give        pay         send         write
               He gave her a present. (IO/DO)
               He gave a present to her. (DO to IO)
               He gave it to her. (DO to IO)
               Note:
               When the direct object is a noun, not a pronoun, we usually put the indirect object before the
               direct object. However, we sometimes put the direct object before the indirect object for emphasis
               or contrast.
                      He didn’t send you the invitation. He sent the invitation to me.


              With some verbs, pronouns don’t affect word order.

               WORD ORDER = DO TO IO                              VERBS
               He described the wedding to his friends. (DO to IO)  announce   introduce  recommend    say
               He described it to them. (DO to IO)                describe   mention     repeat        speak
               He described it to his friends. (DO to IO)         explain    prove       report        suggest

           4.9  Say and Tell

           Say and tell have the same meaning, but we use them differently.

           EXAMPLES                                   EXPLANATION
           She said her name.                         We say something: say + DO.
           She told me her name.                      We tell someone something: tell + IO + DO.

           PART 1  Editing Advice
             1.  Don’t confuse contractions with possessive forms.
                    You’re                It’s
                     Your late for the wedding. Its almost 6 o’clock.

                     His married. He’s wife is a doctor. Their from California.
             2.  Don’t confuse his and her.
                                 her                       his
                     My sister loves his husband. My brother loves her wife.

             3.  Be careful to choose the right pronoun in compound subjects and objects.
                    My mother and I
                     Me and my mother planned the wedding.
                                                me
                     My parents gave my husband and I $500.

             4.  Don’t use an apostrophe to make a plural form.
                                    guests
                     They invited many guest’s to the wedding.

             5.  Don’t use an auxiliary verb in a subject question.
                                 s
                     Who does help the bride?
                                 ^
             6.  Put the apostrophe after the –s of a plural noun that ends in –s.
                       parents’
                     My parent’s house is too small for the wedding.

             7.  Don’t use –s in a possessive adjective. (A possessive adjective has no plural form.)
                     Theirs parents live in Canada.

             8.  Use the correct word order with direct and indirect objects.
                             their wedding customs to me
                     They explained me their wedding customs.

                   although    however    instead    in contrast    on the other hand    but    yet

                   Brides in the Unites States typically wear white wedding dresses. In contrast, brides in China often wear red.

              5.4  Count and Noncount Nouns

              A count noun is something we can count. It has a singular and plural form. A noncount noun
              has just one form.
               EXAMPLES                                       EXPLANATION
               We used one apple in the recipe.               We use a count noun in the singular form or plural form. We
               We used two pears in the recipe.               can put a, an, or a number before a count noun.

                                                              put a, an, or a number before a noncount noun.

              There are several types of noncount nouns.
               GROUP A: NOUNS THAT HAVE NO DISTINCT, SEPARATE PARTS. WE LOOK AT THE WHOLE.

            B:  Just seven. I bought a 12-pound turkey. It was more than enough.

            A:  I don’t know how to prepare a turkey. Is it (a lot of/many) work?
                                                        5.

                    9.
            A:  Have you thought about using paper plates? That way, you won’t have (many/much) work cleaning up.
                                                                               10.
            B:   I know (many/much) people do that, but I want my dinner to look elegant. For me, paper plates are for
                         11.
              picnics.

            A:   That’s true. Also paper plates aren’t very environmentally friendly. It’s better to have (a lot/a lot of) dishes
                                                                                           12.
              to clean, especially with (a lot/a lot of) people to help.
                                        13.
            B:  Right! With help, it wasn’t too (much/many) work.
                                             14.

                   FUN WITH GRAMMAR

             Play a game with units of measure. Form two or three teams. Your teacher will say a noncount noun and one
             team member will go to the board and write the noun with a unit of measure (e.g., water—a glass of water;
             art—a work of art). For each correct answer, the team earns a point. Every student has a turn. The team with the
             most points wins.

            1.       Most American Indians came to America from Siberia.
            2.       Clovis Boy is about 24,000 years old.

            3.       Most of today’s American Indians are genetically connected to Clovis Boy.

           THINK ABOUT IT  Discuss the questions with a partner or in a small group.

            1.   Look at the map on the previous page. Reread the second paragraph and discuss with a partner how people
              might have arrived at the Clovis Boy site in Montana.
            2.   Look at the photograph of Clovis tools. How do you think Clovis people used the tools?


           5.8  There + a Form of Be


           We use there + a form of be to introduce a subject into the conversation.
           EXAMPLES                                                 EXPLANATION
           There is a connection between Clovis Boy and today’s American  We use there is/was to introduce a singular noun.
           Indians.
           There was peace between the American Indians and the
           Pilgrims at first.
           There are American Indian tribes in Montana.             We use there are/were to introduce a plural noun.
           There were Indians in America before Europeans.
           Were there any tools with Clovis Boy?                    For yes/no questions, we put be before there.
           Yes, there were.                                         For an affirmative short answer, we use:
                                                                       Yes, + there + form of be.
           Were there other people with Clovis Boy?                 For a negative short answer, we use:
           No, there weren’t.                                          No,  + there + form of be + not.
           How many tools were there with him?                      We often use how many/how much to ask a
           There were more than 100.                                question with there. We put be before there.
           How much time is there between now and Thanksgiving?
           There are about 28 days.
           Notes:
           1.  We can make a contraction with there is: there’s. We don’t make a contraction with there are.
           2.  If two nouns follow there, we use a singular verb if the first noun is singular. We use a plural
              verb if the first noun is plural.
                  There  was a skeleton and tools at the burial site.    There were tools and a skeleton at the burial site.
           3.  After we introduce a noun with there, we can use a pronoun (they, it, she, etc.) in place of the noun.
                  There is information in Clovis Boy’s DNA.          It’s very important to scientists.
                  There were tools with Clovis Boy.             They give us information about his life.
           4.  For the future, we use there + will be.
                    There will be a documentary about American Indians next week.
                  Will there be a discussion after the movie? Yes, there will.
           5.  In How many questions with a location, we sometimes omit there.
                  How many tools were (there) at the Clovis Boy site?

               EXAMPLES                                     EXPLANATION
               My friend left the reservation because there was   Too much and too many show an excessive quantity. A
               too much unemployment.                       problem with the quantity is presented or implied.
               If we invite too many people to dinner, we won’t
               have enough food.
               A lot of Navajo Indians live in the Southwest.  A lot of shows a large quantity. No problem is presented.
               I feel sick. I ate too much.                 We can put too much at the end of a verb phrase. Note that
                                                            the noun food is omitted. It is understood by the context.

               Note:
               Sometimes we use a lot of in place of too much/too many.
                   If we invite a lot of people to dinner, we won’t have enough food.





              EXERCISE 16  Fill in the blanks with a lot of, too much, or too many. In some cases, more than one
              answer is possible.

                3.  I’m so busy before Thanksgiving. I have no time to rest. I have                things to do.

                4.  I love garlic. This recipe calls for                 garlic, so it’s going to be delicious.

                5.  She’s going to bake a cherry pie for Thanksgiving. She needs                 cherries.

                6.  I think I ate                      pieces of pie. Now I feel sick.

           EXAMPLES                                     EXPLANATION
           Rich countries waste food.                   An adjective can come before a noun.

           The problem is huge.                         An adjective can come after be, seem, and the sense-

            GRAMMAR IN USE
            In conversation, we often use informal modifiers before adjectives to express degree. Some of these words and
            phrases are: pretty, sort of, kind of, really, and real. It’s better not to use these in academic writing.
                I was kind of surprised by the article.
                The food situation sounds really bad.

           6.5  Adjectives vs. Adverbs


           An adjective describes a noun. An adverb describes a verb (phrase), an adjective, or another adverb.

           EXAMPLES                                     EXPLANATION
           Boulder is easy to get around on foot.       Easy is an adjective. It describes a noun—in this case, Boulder.
           You can get around easily on foot.           Easily is an adverb of manner. It tells how you can go from
                                                        place to place.
           People in Boulder seem happy.                We use an adjective, not an adverb, after the following verbs
           I felt great after the hike.                 if we are describing the subject: smell, sound, taste, look, seem,
                                                        appear, and feel.
           People always smile happily.                 We use an adverb of manner if we are describing how the
           The hike greatly improved my mood.           action (the verb phrase) is done.

           If you don't eat well, you can get sick.     We use an adjective, not an adverb, in expressions with get.
           They got hungry during the hike.             Some expressions with get are get hungry, get tired, get sick,
                                                        and get rich.
           He’s sick. He doesn’t feel well today.       For health, we use well.
           Boulder residents are really healthy.        We use an adverb before an adjective or another adverb.
           They exercise and eat very well.
           As usual, they went to the farmers’ market on   We use the adjective, not the adverb, in the expression

               EXAMPLES                                        EXPLANATION

                                                               We put too before adjectives and adverbs. Too indicates a

               You work too hard and don’t relax.

               You spend too much time on the computer.        We put too much before a noncount noun.


               You spend too many hours watching TV.           We put too many before a count noun.


               He doesn’t sleep well because he worries too much.  We put too much at the end of the verb phrase.

               Five hours of sleep is not good enough.         We put enough after adjectives and adverbs.


               You worked hard enough. Get some rest now.


               Some people don’t get enough exercise.          We put enough before noncount and count nouns.

               Do you get enough hours of sleep?

               Note:
               An infinitive can follow a phrase with too and enough.
                   I’m too tired to drive.
                   I don’t have enough time to exercise.




                GRAMMAR IN USE
                Too + adjective indicates that there is too much of something and usually has a negative connotation (e.g., That
                watch is too expensive.). Sometimes we use too with certain positive adjectives to emphasize the feeling (e.g., You’re
                too kind. She's too generous.). Such statements don’t suggest a problem. They just bring attention to a large amount
                of something.

               WRITING TIP
               When comparing or contrasting, it is useful to use transition words to help connect ideas.
               To show similarity, you can use transitions such as: similarly, also, in comparison, as well, likewise, and like.
                   There is a lot of diverse food in the United States. Likewise, in Canada people enjoy many different cuisines.
               To show difference, you can use transitions such as: but, however, on the other hand, on the contrary,
               nevertheless, and unlike.
                   In the U.S., I eat bread every day. In Taiwan, however, I ate rice instead.

           7.3  The Past Continuous—Form


           To form the past continuous, we use was or were + the present participle (-ing form of the verb).

           Notes:
           1.  The contraction for was not is wasn’t. The contraction for were not is weren’t.
           2.  We can put an adverb between was/were and the present participle.

           He was working in a hospital when he heard     We use the past continuous with the simple past in the
           the news.                                      same sentence to show the relationship of a longer past

           Note:
           If the main clause precedes the time clause, do not separate the two clauses with a comma.
                  He was working in a hospital when he heard the news.
           If the time clause precedes the main clause, separate the two clauses with a comma.
                  When he heard the news, he was working in a hospital.





            GRAMMAR IN USE
            The past continuous is used to recount events or tell stories. It helps set the scene and portray the mood. The past
            continuous can also build suspense, which then may be interrupted by an action in the story in the simple past.

                  The wind was howling, and a fresh layer of snow was quickly covering everything in sight. One lonely car was
                inching along on the slippery road. Suddenly the car stopped . . .



           EXERCISE 8  Use the past continuous for the longer action and the simple past for the shorter action.

           While he was living in the U.S., he wrote many   We use while + the past continuous with the longer action.
           papers.

           Notes:
           1.  We can use when in place of while with a continuous action.
                 While Einstein was living in Switzerland, he developed his theory.
                 When Einstein was living in Switzerland, he developed his theory.
           2.  We cannot use while with an action that is not continuous.
                 not: Einstein was living in the U.S. while he died.
           3.  The simple past form of be often has a continuous meaning.
                 While Einstein was outside the country, the Nazis took his property.
           4.  We use the past continuous in both clauses if the two actions occurred at the same time.
                 While Einstein was working at the patent office, he was thinking about his theory.

              When the main clause and the time clause have the same subject, we can delete the subject
              of the time clause and use a present participle (verb + -ing) after the time word.

               1.  Imagine the following situation. You are a tenant with a one-year lease. After two months, you receive a
                 letter from the landlord that rent is increasing by $100. What would you say or do?
               2.  What are some issues that a tenant and landlord might need to negotiate? You can use ideas from the article
                 or your own experience.


              8.1  Overview of Modals

              Modals add meaning to the verbs that follow them. The modal verbs are can, could, should,
              would, may, might, and must.

               EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION
               A renter must sign a lease.                       The base form of the verb follows a modal.
               A tenant can ask for changes before signing the lease.  A modal never has an -s ending.
               You should not pay your rent late.                To form the negative, we put not after the modal. The
               I cannot understand my lease.                     negative of can is written as one word: cannot. The
                                                                 contraction for cannot is can’t.
               If you don’t trust the landlord, you should probably   We can put an adverb between the modal and the
               look for another apartment.                       main verb.

              Notice these seven patterns with a modal:
                affirmative statement:       We can have a cat in the apartment.
                negative statement:          We can’t have a dog.
                yes/no question:             Can we have a bird?
                short answer:                Yes, you can.
                wh- question:                Why  can we have a cat?
                negative wh- question:       Why can’t we have a dog?
                subject question:            Who can have a dog?



              8.2  Phrasal Modals

              Phrasal modals are expressions that are like modals in meaning.

               EXPRESSIONS                         EXAMPLES

               Can is not usually stressed in affirmative statements. In negative statements, can’t is stressed, but it can be hard to
               hear the final t. So we must pay attention to the vowel sound and stress to hear the difference between can and can’t.

               1.       In many U.S. cities, you should put plastic in one bin and glass, metal, and paper in another.
               2.       In many U.S. cities, plastic bags go in the recycling bin.

               3.       It is OK to put a dirty container in the recycling bin with the cap on.

              THINK ABOUT IT  Discuss the questions with a partner or in a small group.

               1.  According to the reading, why should we reduce and recycle? Explain in your own words.
               2.   The reading gives tips for using less plastic. What are they? Do you do these things? What else should you do?
                 Think of at least one more idea.


              8.7  Advice—Should, Ought To, Had Better



               EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION
               You should bring your own shopping bag to the store.   For advice, we use should.
               You shouldn’t put plastic bags in the recycling bin.     Should = It’s a good idea.
                                                                   Shouldn’t = It’s a bad idea.
               Everyone ought to recycle plastic.                Ought to means the same as should. We don’t usually use
                                                                 ought to in questions or negatives.
               Plastic is in our food and drinking water. We had better   When it is probable that something bad or unpleasant
               do something about this problem before it’s too late.   will happen, we use had better (not).
               We’d better not wait much longer.                 The contraction for had (in had better) is ’d.
                                                                   I’d    you’d    he’d    she’d    we’d    they’d

               Note:
               Should is for advice. Must is for obligation or necessity.
               Compare:
                     You should bring your own shopping bags to the store. (advice)
                     You must pay 10 cents for each new bag at the store. (obligation)
               Pronunciation Note:
               Native speakers often don’t pronounce had or the ’d in had better. You will hear people say:
                      If you are unsure about the recycling rules, you better ask.




              EXERCISE 8  Complete each sentence with should/ought to, shouldn’t, or ’d better.

               1.  The blue bin is for recycling. You   shouldn’t   put garbage in there.

               2.  All glass and plastic bottles             go in the recycling bin.

               3.  You                  not pour cooking oil down the sink. It can block the drain.

               4.  Everyone                  use less plastic. It’s good for the environment.

               5.  You                  put broken glass in recycling. It goes in the garbage bin.

               6.  You                  bring your own cup to a coffeeshop. You’ll get a discount.

                          NEW COUNTRY                                                            A neighborhood party





              Read the following article. Pay special attention to the words in bold.   8.4

                 You’re about to go to college in the United States. Or your family just moved to the United
              States. Your friends back home tell you, “It must be so exciting to live in a new country.” But
              there are so many new rules and customs to learn. After the excitement wears off  , there are
                                                                                      1
              many questions you’ll have and decisions you have to make.
                 Now you’re here, and you find yourself in situations that are completely new to you. You
              might ask yourself: “Should I buy a car or use public transportation? Should I get a roommate?
              If so, how and where? How do I find a doctor? Where do I get insurance? How do I find a job?
              When and where do I tip?” There must be hundreds of things you never thought about before.

                 In addition to those practical things, you might also wonder about social differences. You
              might ask yourself: “What topics are appropriate for making small talk here? What topics
              might not be so good? Why did the person I am talking to step back from me? Did I say
              something wrong?” It might be that you are standing too close. People in the U.S. like their
              personal space. This is one of many unspoken rules that might be new to you.

                 Besides questions you have about life in the United States, you’re probably discovering
              that many Americans are curious about you. Of course, they’ll ask you where you’re from.
              Keep in mind that they might not know much about your country or culture. If you say Sri
              Lanka, for example, they may have no idea where this is. They might not understand the
              differences between different Asian countries. If you’re from Brazil, people might think you
              speak Spanish. People who think that must not know that Portuguese is the language of
              Brazil. Just explain where you’re from and what language you speak.
                 With time, you’ll learn more about American behaviors, and others will learn more about
              you and your native culture.

              8.11  Using Modals for Politeness



               EXAMPLES                                      EXPLANATION

               Why don’t you buy your bed online?            We can use a negative question to offer a polite suggestion.

               Notes:
                 1.  When asking for permission, it is more polite to use may or could rather than can.

            Choosing the correct level of politeness for a situation will make your English sound more natural. In formal
            situations, use these modal phrases:

                May I please speak to . . . ?
                Could you please tell me where . . . ?
                I would like to make an appointment.
            In less formal contexts, you can use other phrases:
                Can I speak to . . . ?
                Can you tell me where . . . ?
                I want to make an appointment.
            If you are uncertain of the situation, it’s better to be too polite than not polite enough.




           EXERCISE 17  The conversation takes place in a second-hand store. Person A is a shopper; Person B
           is a salesperson. Make the language more polite by using modals and other expressions in place of the
           underlined words. Answers may vary.

            A:  Excuse me.
                   May I help you?
            B:  Yes? Do you need help?
                          1.
            A:  Yes. I want to see that lamp—the one on the shelf. Show it to me, please.
                      2.                                       3.
            B:  Sure. Wait a minute. I have to get a ladder. (A moment later) OK, here’s the lamp.
                        4.
            A:  Thanks. It’s nice, but does it work?


            B:   I think so, but let’s check. I’ll plug it in. Yes, it works.
                               5.
            A:  Great. Tell me how much it is.
                             6.
            B:  Let’s see. It’s 15 dollars.
            A:  OK, I’ll take it.


            B:  Do you want to see any other lamps?
                     7.
            A:  Yes, show me that blue one, please.
                     8.
            B:  Sure, here you go.
            A:  It’s nice, but it’s 30 dollars, and I don’t want to spend that much money.
                                                    9.
            B:  Sure, I understand. Do you want to see anything else?

            A:   No, thanks. I’m done shopping. I’ll just pay for this lamp.


            B:  Do you want to pay by debit or credit card?

               WRITING TIP
               When comparing things, there are different ways to organize your ideas. One option is to write about the first topic,
               for example, apartment life in the United States. You cover that topic completely and then write about the next
               topic you are comparing, for example, apartment life in Brazil.
               Another option is to write about one point of similarity or difference between the two topics, for example, In the
               United States, neighbors aren’t typically friendly with each other. In Brazil, however, neighbors usually know one another
               well. Then you would write about another point of similarity or difference between the two topics.


              PART 3  Write
              Read the prompts. Choose one and write a paragraph or two about it.
              1.  Compare apartment life in the United States with apartment life in another country.
              2.  Compare driving rules in the United States with driving rules in another country.

              Reread the Summary of Unit 8 and the editing advice. Edit your writing from Part 3.

                GRAMMAR IN USE
                Contractions are common in speaking, both formally and informally. They make your speech sound more fluent
                and natural. We also use them in informal writing, such as in emails to friends or personal letters. However, many
                teachers do not want students to use contractions in formal academic writing (essays, research papers).

                GRAMMAR IN USE
                When an event happened in the recent past, and the effect is still felt, we often use the present perfect. This is
                especially common for speakers of British English. In American English, we use either the present perfect or the
                simple past.
                   Someone  has just donated $10,000!     Someone just donated $10,000.
                   I have forgotten my password again.    I forgot my password again.
                   Have you heard the news?               Did you hear the news?

            The news is typically about things important today. Often, a news story begins with the present perfect to give
            important information, and then it continues in the simple past to tell what happened, or the simple present to
            describe current feelings or thoughts.

              Twelve boys and their coach have disappeared in Thailand. No one has seen them since their soccer game on June
              23rd. A bypasser found their bikes and bags near a cave entrance. A teammate said the boys went into the cave after
              their game. Unfortunately, it rained heavily soon after. Officials fear they are lost in the cave, unable to get out.

              9.7  The Present Perfect with Repetition from Past to Present



                                                                      NOW
                         PAST                     X X X                                         FUTURE
                                     I have seen 3 videos this week.




               EXAMPLES                                        EXPLANATION

               Khan has appeared on TV many times.             We use the present perfect to talk about repetition
               Up to now, Khan Academy has created over        in a time period that includes the present. We expect
               5,000 videos.                                   more repetition. Adding the words so far and up to now
               I have watched 10 videos on Khan Academy so far.   indicate that we are counting up to the present moment.
               How many times has Khan been on TV?             We can ask a question about repetition from past to
               How much money has he charged for his videos?   present with how much and how many.
               He hasn’t charged any money at all for his videos.  To indicate zero times, we can use a negative
                                                               verb + at all.

               Notes:
               We use the present perfect in a time period that is open. There is a possibility of more repetition.
                   Khan has made over 3,000 videos so far. (possibility for more videos)
                   Khan has added new subjects over the years. (possibility for adding more subjects)
               We use the simple past with a time period that is finished or closed: in 2004, 50 years ago, last week, etc.
               There is no possibility of more repetition.
                   Khan made a few videos in 2004 for his niece. (2004 ends the time period)




                GRAMMAR IN USE
                When you consider the action finished, use the simple past.
                   I read many great books in high school.
                When you know that the action might happen again in the future, use the present perfect.
                   I’ve read many great books.

              The U.S. Census    has been collecting       information every 10 years since 1790.

           What is the difference between the early census and the census today?

              In 1790, when the population was less than four million, the government wanted to find out how many

           men were eligible for military service, so census workers didn’t even count children. In more recent years, the

           government                              this information to give citizens representation in Congress and

              At first the census results were available to everyone. More recently, the government

           census forms to people through the U.S. mail.

              For many years, the census forms were only in English. In recent years, the U.S. government

           PART 1  Editing Advice

            1. Don’t confuse the -ing form and the past participle.
                            taking
                     I’ve been taken a course in genealogy.
                                   given
                     My parents have giving me family photos.
            2. Use the present perfect, not the simple present or present continuous, to describe an action or
                state that started in the past and continues to the present.
                             had                             have you been
                         He has his laptop for two years.  How long are you studying math?
                              ^                                    ^
            3. Use for, not since, with the amount of time.
                                                         for
                     I’ve been interested in my family’s history since three years.
            4. Use the simple past, not the present perfect, with a specific past time.
                        studied
                     He has studied algebra when he was in high school.
                           did    study
                     When have you studied algebra?
            5. Use the simple past, not the present perfect, in a since clause.
                                                  put
                     He has collected $5,000 since he has put his project on a crowdfunding site.
            6. Use the correct word order with adverbs.
                         never studied                       ever heard
                     I have studied never my family history.  Have you heard ever of Dr. Spencer Wells?
            7. Use the correct word order in questions.
                            has your family
                     How long your family has been in this country?
            8. Use yet for negative statements; use already for affirmative statements.
                                                   yet
                     I haven’t taken advanced algebra already.

            9. Don’t forget the verb have in the present perfect (continuous).
                    have
                     I been studying my family history for two years.
                     ^
            10.  Don’t forget the -ed of the past participle.
                             ed
                     He’s watch a math video several times.

               WRITING TIP
               When you write a paragraph or essay about a change in your life, start your paper with a sentence that states how
               the new situation (technology, for example) has changed your life.
                 Since I got a cell phone, my life has greatly improved.
               Then use the simple past to talk about what you used to do and the simple present to talk about what you do
               habitually now.
                 Before I got a cell phone, I went to work in the morning and only talked to my family at night. Now, I call before I go
                 home to ask if they need anything.

              PART 3  Write
              Read the prompts. Choose one and write a paragraph or two about it.

              1.  Write about the changes that you have made since you came to this country, city, or school.
              2.  Write about new technology that you’ve started using recently. How has that made your life
                 different?

              PART 4  Edit
              Reread the Summary of Unit 9 and the editing advice. Edit your writing from Part 3.

          FINDING a JOB








           Read the following article. Pay special attention to the words in bold.   10.1

              Finding a job in the United States takes time and effort. Here are some tips  to help you:
                                                                                1
                                                      2
              •  Write a good résumé. Include only relevant  experience. Describe your
                accomplishments . Avoid including unnecessary information. Consider asking
                                3
                a friend to read your résumé to check it for grammar and spelling mistakes.
              •   Find out about available jobs. One way is by looking on the Internet. Another way is by
                networking. Networking means exchanging information with anyone you know who
                might know of a job. These people might be able to give you insider information about a
                company, such as who is in charge of hiring and what it is like to work at their company.
                You can find out about a job before it is even advertised. The Wall Street Journal reports
                that 94 percent of people who succeed in finding a job say that networking was a big help.

              •  Practice before you go for an interview. The more prepared you are, the more relaxed
                                                     4
                you will feel and the more you will convey  confidence. If you are worried about
                saying or doing the wrong thing, practice will help.
              •   Learn something about the company by going to the company’s website.
              •  Arrive at least 15 minutes before the scheduled time of your interview. Feeling relaxed
                is important. Arriving on time or just a few minutes before the interview doesn’t give
                you time to relax.


           1   tip: useful information
           2   relevant: closely connected
           3   accomplishment: a difficult thing done well
           4   to convey: to communicate

Avoid chewing gum. Turn off your cell
                    phone completely.

                 •   Avoid saying anything negative about your current job or employer.
                 •   One question might be, “Tell me something about yourself.” Instead of talking
                    about your personal life, focus on your skills and work experience. Answer each
                                    5
                    question concisely . Avoid giving long answers.
                 •   At the end of the interview, offer a firm handshake. Thanking the interviewer by
                    letter or email a few days later is a good idea.

                 Some people send out hundreds of résumés and go on dozens of interviews before
              finding a job. Looking for a job isn’t something you do just once or twice in your lifetime.



              5    concisely: using few words to communicate



              COMPREHENSION  Based on the reading, write T for true or F for false.
               1.       Networking means getting information from the Internet.

               2.       Arriving right on time to an interview is a good idea.
               3.       Thanking the interviewer with a handshake is enough.


              THINK ABOUT IT  Discuss the questions with a partner or in a small group.
               1.  What networking opportunities exist today for people who are looking for work?

               2.   If an interviewer asked you to describe your greatest weakness, what could you say that would also show
                 something positive about you?



              10.1  Gerunds—An Overview

              A gerund is the –ing form of a verb.
               EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION
                                                                 A gerund (phrase) can be:
               Finding a job is hard.                               •  the subject of a sentence.
               I recommend talking to a job counselor.              •  the object of the verb.
               Are you thinking about changing careers?             •  the object of a preposition.
               I’m worried about not getting a good job.         We put not in front of a gerund to make it negative.

               Note:
               A gerund phrase is a gerund + a noun or noun phrase.

            1.      You should speak up if you are unhappy about working on a project.

           You care     about keeping        your job. You may not be aware                        things that

           can make your supervisor think less of you. So here are a few tips:

            •  Avoid                         about things you have to do. If you dislike                    on
                               3.                                                             4.
             a project, keep it to yourself. Don't say, “It’s not my job.” Even if you don’t like
                                                                                            5.

                                            6.
            •  Practice                                  positive words to show confidence and a good attitude.
                                      7.
                                        “It’s not fair” makes you sound like a child.

                                                      11.
             try                           yourself and analyzing what you say.
                            12.
            •  Don’t point out your weaknesses. “I’m not good                  reports” sounds bad. Instead
                                                                 13.
             say, “I want to do a good job. I’d like to work with someone who can help me learn to write better reports.”

             •                          a coworker that you don't like a supervisor is not a good idea. You never
                         14.
             know what this person might say to the supervisor.

               EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION

               Do you enjoy working on a team?                   A gerund (phrase) can be the object of many verbs.
               Avoid complaining about your supervisor.
               I went shopping for work clothes last weekend.    We use go + gerund in expressions of recreational
               After work, I like to go swimming.                activities.
               A gerund (phrase) can follow these verbs:
               admit                    dislike                  love                     quit
               appreciate               enjoy                    mind                     recommend
               avoid                    finish                   miss                     start
               begin                    hate                     postpone                 stop
               consider                 imagine                  practice                 suggest
               continue                 keep (on)                prefer
               discuss                  like                     put off
               We use go + gerund in the following expressions:
               go boating               go camping               go fishing               go hunting
               go jogging               go shopping              go skating               go swimming
               go bowling               go dancing               go hiking                go skiing

              Notes:
              1.  I mind means that something bothers me. I don’t mind means that something is OK with me; it
                 doesn’t bother me.
                     Do you mind wearing a suit to work? No, I don’t mind.
              2.  Put off means “postpone.”
                    Don’t put off writing your résumé. Do it now.

              10.5  Infinitives—An Overview


              An infinitive is to + the base form of a verb.
               EXAMPLES                                  EXPLANATION
                                                         We can use an infinitive after:
               Are you happy to go to work?                 • certain adjectives.
               I need to take a break.                      • certain verbs.
               It’s important to hire the right people.     • expressions beginning with it.
               They decided not to hire me.              To make an infinitive negative, we put not before the infinitive.

              Note:
              When we connect two infinitives with and, we usually omit to after and.
                    He wants to take a break and rest.

           EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION
           I need to find a better job.                     An infinitive (phrase) can follow certain verbs.
           I want to make more money.
           An infinitive can follow these verbs:

           agree            decide          learn           remember         begin*          love*
           attempt          expect          need            try              continue*       prefer*

           choose           hope            promise         would like       like*
           Notes:
           1. A gerund can also follow these verbs* with little or no difference in meaning. See chart 10.3.
                  I love to work with children. = I love working with children.
           2. Plan on + gerund is the same as plan + infinitive.
                  I plan on seeing a counselor. = I plan to see a counselor.
           3. Remember that in some expressions, to is part of a verb phrase, not part of an infinitive.
                  I look forward to starting my new job. (verb + to + gerund)
                  I need to write a résumé. (verb + infinitive)

           PART 1  Editing Advice

                     It’s important to they to finish their project on time.

               WRITING TIP
               Gerunds and infinitives are very common in writing. Gerunds are used as subjects and as objects of prepositions.
               Infinitives are most often used as objects of verbs. Be sure to include them in your writing.
               If you choose prompt 1 below, you may use a gerund subject for your topic sentence and use prepositions +
               gerunds in your examples.
                   Working in Italy is very different from working in the United States. In the U.S., people are used to working all the time.
                 In Italy, people are good about leaving work at work and relaxing when home.
               For prompt 2, recall that like/not like can take a gerund or infinitive.
                   At my last job, the work day started at 6:00 a.m. I didn’t like waking up at 5:00 every morning, but I liked to walk to
                 work while the city was still quiet.
               Incorporate a variety of verbs to express preferences (enjoy, hate, dislike, prefer, appreciate) but remember to check
               whether gerunds or infinitives or both can follow.


              PART 3  Write
              Read the prompts. Choose one and write a paragraph about it.
              1.  Write about the differences between working in the U.S. and working in another country.
                 You may write about coworkers, salary, vacation time, relationships with superiors, punctuality,
                 or another topic about work that interests you.
              2.  Write about your current job or a job you had in the past. Tell what you like(d) or don’t (didn’t)
                 like about that job.

              11.1  Adjective Clauses—Overview



               EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION
               Today it is common to find married women who have   An adjective clause is a group of words that contains
               not changed their names.                          a subject and verb. It describes or identifies the noun
               What is the name of the high school that you attended? before it (women, high school).
               Notes:
                 1.  Who, whom, that, which, whose, where, and when mark the beginning of an adjective clause.
                  Sometimes an adjective clause begins with no marker.
                      I have a lot of friends who moved away after we graduated.
                      The friends I had in high school are married now. (no marker)
                 2.  Some adjective clauses are set apart from the rest of the sentence with commas.
                      I like to look at my yearbook, which has photos of my classmates.
                 3.  An adjective clause can identify any noun in a sentence.
                      Von Steuben High School, which is located in Chicago, is a science academy.
                      I attended Von Steuben High School, which is located in Chicago.
                 4.  Compare adjectives and adjective clauses. An adjective precedes a noun. An adjective clause
                  follows a noun.
                      I attended a big high school.
                      I attended a high school that has over 5,000 students.

               Punctuation Note:
               When the noun is unique, we set the adjective clause apart from the rest of the sentence with
               commas. We use only who and which; we don’t use that.
                      I want to move to a state that has low unemployment. (no comma)

                GRAMMAR IN USE
                Adjective clauses are common in both written and spoken English. They make your writing and speech more
                fluent. Instead of using short, simple sentences to express an idea, try to combine ideas using adjective clauses.
                For example:

              The relative pronoun can be the object of the adjective clause.

                               object
                      I found my friend on a social media site.

               Notes:
                 1.  The relative pronouns who(m), that, and which can be the object of the adjective clause. In conversation,
                  we usually omit the relative pronoun when it is the object of the adjective clause.
                      I contacted an old friend I found on a social media site.
                      The high school she attended is in New York City.
                 2.  Whom is more formal than who. However, the relative pronoun is usually omitted altogether in conversation.
                      I reconnected with an old friend who(m) I saw at the reunion.
                      I reconnected with an old friend I saw at the reunion.

               Punctuation Note:
               When the noun is unique, we set the adjective clause apart from the rest of the sentence with commas.
               We use only who and which; we don’t use that.
                      The high school (that) she attended is very small. (no comma)
                      Taft High School, which I attended from 1998–2002, is very small. (Taft High School is unique.)




              EXERCISE 4  Underline the adjective clause in each sentence.

               1.  I’ve lost touch with some of the friends I had in high school.

               2.  The high school I attended is in another city.

               3.  The teachers I had in high school are all old now.

               4.  We didn’t have to buy the textbooks we used in high school.

               5.  My best friend married a man she met in college.

             Define people, places, and things. Form two teams. Team A thinks of a person, place, or thing. Team B works
             together to define it using an adjective clause. Then switch roles. For each correct sentence, the team earns a
             point. The team with the most points wins.

                 Team A: a giraffe
                 Team B: A giraffe is an animal that has a long neck and eats leaves.

           1. Think of an interest or hobby you have. Do you think there is a Meetup for that? Would you be interested in
              joining such a Meetup? If there isn’t such a Meetup, would you like to create such a group? Why or why not?

           11.4  Relative Pronouns as Objects of Prepositions


           A relative pronoun can be the object of a preposition.

           I want to find people.
                                                    prep.  object
                                    I can go to a play with them.


                            who(m)
           I want to find people  Ø  I can go to a play with. (informal)
                             that
           I want to find people with whom I can go to a play. (formal)

                          prep.          object
           We are interested in different types of books.

           My friend and I like different books.
                              that
           I did not like the book  Ø  she told me about. (informal)
                             which
           I did not like the book about which she told me. (formal)

           Notes:
             1. Informally, we put the preposition at the end of the adjective clause. The relative pronoun is
              usually omitted. The most common way to say the above sentences is:
                  I want to find people I can go to a play with.   I did not enjoy the book you told me about.
             2. In very formal English, the preposition comes before the relative pronoun, and only whom and
              which may be used. That and who are not used directly after a preposition.
                  I want to find people with whom I can go to a play. (not with who or with that)
                  I did not enjoy the book about which you told me. (not about that)

           Punctuation Notes:
             1. When the adjective clause is not essential to identify the noun, we set it apart from the rest of the sentence with
              commas.
                  Heiferman, who(m) we read about, is a member of a Meetup. (We know who Heiferman is without the
                  adjective clause.)
             2. A nonessential adjective clause begins with who, whom, which, where, when, or whose. We don’t use that.

               1.      Alexa and Gabby met and became friends in a high school math class.
               2.      Most people become friends with another person because they don’t want to be alone.

               3.       According to the reading, a close friend is someone that we can talk to about personal things and who
                       helps us in hard times.


              THINK ABOUT IT  Discuss the questions with a partner or in a small group.

               1.  Think of one of your good friends. How did you meet and become friends?
               2.  How does this person fit the definition of a close friend given in the passage? Give an example.


              11.6  Adjective Clauses with Where and When


              Some adjective clauses begin with the relative adverbs where and when.

               EXAMPLES                                                           EXPLANATION
               Alexa met Gabby at Woodside High, where they went to high school.  Where means “in that place.”
               There was a café where they went every day.
               “I still remember the day (when) we met,” says Alexa.              When means “at that time.”
               “It was in 2014, when we were in high school.”
               Punctuation Note:
               When the adjective clause is not essential to identify the noun, we set it apart from the rest of the sentence with
               commas.
                   They went to Java House, where they studied. (We don’t need the adjective clause to identify the place.)
                   We met on the first day of school, when we were in high school. (We don’t need the adjective clause to identify
                   the day.)
               We can omit when in a sentence with no comma. We cannot omit where.




              EXERCISE 11  Two friends are talking about how they met. Write each adjective clause in the correct
              place to complete the dialogue.
                 when we were studying            when we met
                 where we took that class         where we could buy hot tea
                 when it was very cold            when I passed the TOEFL

             1.  Use who or that to introduce a person. Use that or which to introduce a thing.
                             that
                     The states what are losing the most population are in cold climates.

                     I have many friends which go to Meetups.

             2.  If the relative pronoun is the subject of the adjective clause, don’t omit it.
                                   that
                     She started a group now has 100 members.
                                     ^
             3.  Use whose to substitute for a possessive form.

                     Gabby, her father was an actor, hopes to find work in movies.

             4.  If the relative pronoun is used as the object of the adjective clause, don’t put an object after the
                verb of the adjective clause.
                     There are a lot of interesting Meetups that I found them.

             5.  Use subject-verb agreement in the adjective clause.
                                        s
                     I have a friend who live  in Madrid.
                                        ^
             6.  Put a noun before an adjective clause.
                A person who
                      Who has a few good friends is lucky.

             7.  Use where, not that, to mean “in a place.”
                                            where
                     She moved to North Dakota, that she found a good job.
             8.  Use whom and which, not who and that, if the preposition precedes the relative pronoun.
                                     which
                     He found a group in that he’s interested.
                                               whom
                     I’ve never met the person about who you are talking.

             9.  Use the correct word order in an adjective clause (subject before verb).
                                  Gabby acted in
                     The first play that acted in Gabby was at her high school.

            10. Don’t confuse whose (possessive form) and who’s (who is).
                             who's
                     A woman whose in my science Meetup teaches biology at a high school.

               WRITING TIP
               Using a variety of adjectives and adjective clauses to describe nouns will make your writing more interesting. If you
               are writing about friendships (prompt 1), you might want to describe the kinds of people you were friends with
               when you were younger compared to now:

                 When I was younger, my friends were people who were in the drama club. Now my friends are people who have
                 young children like me.
               If you are writing about two types of relationships (prompt 2), you could describe the differences between the two:

                 At work, I’m friendly with people who are serious and reliable. When I’m away from work, I prefer to spend time with
                 people who are relaxed and fun to be around.


              PART 3  Write
              Read the prompts. Choose one and write a paragraph about it.

              1.  Compare the friendships you have today with the friendships you had when you were younger.
              2.  Compare your social relationships with your work relationships.

              12.8  Showing Similarity with Like and Alike


              We can show that two things are similar (or not) with like and alike.

               EXAMPLES                                                 EXPLANATION
               Pattern A:                                               Pattern A:
               A soccer player looks like a rugby player.               Noun 1 + verb + like + noun 2.
               A soccer player doesn’t look like a football player.
               Pattern B:                                               Pattern B:
               A soccer player and a rugby player look alike.           Noun 1 and noun 2 + verb + alike.
               A soccer player and a football player don’t look alike.
               Pattern A:                                               Pattern A:
               He is like his brother in some ways. They both love soccer.  Noun 1 + be like + noun 2.
               He is not like his sister. They have different interests.
               Pattern B:                                               Pattern B:
               He and his brother are alike in some ways.               Noun 1 and noun 2 + be alike.
               He and his sister are not alike.
               Notes:
               1.  We use the sense perception verbs (look, sound, smell, taste, feel, and seem) with like and alike to
                  show an outward similarity or difference.
               2.  We can use other verbs with like/alike: act, sing, dress, think, etc.
                      A soccer player doesn’t dress like a football player.
                      A soccer player and a football player don’t dress alike.
               3.  We use be like/be alike to show an inward similarity or difference.
                     Erik is like his teammates. He’s a strong climber. (be like = an inward similarity)



                GRAMMAR IN USE
                Questions with What + like or What + look like don’t ask for comparisons. They ask for a description:

                   What is he like? (asks about personality) He’s funny and really smart.
                   What is it like? (asks for a description) It’s challenging.
                   What does he look like? (asks for a physical description) He’s tall with brown hair.

                When Who is used instead of What in these questions, similarities are asked for:
                   Who is he like? He’s like his brother. They are both athletic.
                   Who does he look like? He looks like his father. They are both tall and handsome.



                                                                                         Superlatives, Comparatives  331

               WRITING TIP
               When you write an essay, you need an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. The introduction includes your
               thesis statement, which expresses the central point of your essay. Each body paragraph introduces a main idea and

                  One of the most famous cases heard in the Supreme Court     is known           as Brown v.

           law and took their case to the Supreme Court in 1953. The Supreme Court ruled that children

           unconstitutional.

                                 10.

           13.2  The Passive Voice—Form

           To form the passive voice, we use be + the past participle of the verb.

                              ACTIVE                                 PASSIVE
           Simple Present     The Constitution protects Americans.   Americans are protected by the Constitution.
           Future             The judge will make a decision.        A decision will be made soon.
                              The judge is going to make a decision.  A decision is going to be made soon.
           Simple Past        Parents challenged the school board.   The school board was challenged in 1953.
           Present Perfect    The court has heard the case.          The case has been heard by the court.
           Infinitive         The court has to make a decision.      A decision has to be made by the court.
           Modal              They should change the law.            The law should be changed.
           Notes:
           1.  The tense of the sentence is shown by the verb be. The past participle of the main verb is used
             with every tense.
           2. An adverb can be placed between the auxiliary verb and the main verb.
                  The attorneys are often asked questions.
           3. When the agent is included after a passive verb, we use by + noun or object pronoun.
                  I was helped by the attorneys.    My sister was helped by them, too.
           4. If two verbs in the passive voice are connected with and, we don’t repeat the verb be.
                  All schools were affected and required to desegregate.
           5.  Some active verbs have two objects: a direct object and an indirect object. When this is the
             case, the passive sentence can begin with either object. If the direct object becomes the subject
             of the passive sentence, to is used before the indirect object.
                  Active: They gave the child permission.
                  Passive: The child was given permission.    Permission was given to the child.

                The passive voice is useful in reporting facts objectively. The passive puts emphasis on the receiver or object of
                the action (e.g., Two people were injured in the accident.). It also takes emphasis away from an unknown subject
                (e.g., The painting was stolen from the museum.).
                The passive also allows a writer or speaker to adjust the focus. For example:

                   Judge Brown sentenced Mel Simon to 10 years in prison. (active)
                   Mel Simon was sentenced to 10 years in prison. (passive)
                In the active voice, focus is placed on the judge. In the passive voice, Mel Simon is the focus.




              EXERCISE 3  Change each sentence to passive voice. Use the same tense. Do not include the agent.

               1.  They take a vote.  A vote is taken.

               2.  They made a decision.

               3.  They will take a vote.

               4.  They are going to change the law.

               5.  We have paid the attorneys.

               6.  We must find a good lawyer.

               7.  They need to write a report.


              EXERCISE 4  Underline the verb. Then write A if the sentence is active or P if the sentence is passive.

                1.  The justices discussed the case in private.   A

                2.  A decision was made to change the law.   P

                5.  Some laws need to be changed.

                6.  The justices sometimes interrupt the attorneys.

                7.  Some justices will retire soon.

                8.  In many court cases, witnesses are brought in.

                9.  In criminal court, witnesses are questioned.

                10.  Schools in Kansas separated African-American children from other children.

                11.  The first African-American justice was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1967.

                12.  Things have changed a lot in the last 60 years.

                   FUN WITH GRAMMAR

             Be a news reporter. Work with a partner to prepare a short TV news report. The goal is to use the passive voice
             correctly and effectively. The news can be true or made up. You can talk about any news topic: the weather,
             famous people, crime, politics, personal interest stories, etc. The class will listen and write down uses of the
             passive. Then the class will vote on the most engaging news report.

           The Active Voice—Use
           EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION
           I hired an attorney.                              In most cases, when either the active or passive can be

           She went to court.                                voice must be used. There is no choice.



           The Passive Voice—Use

           EXAMPLES                                          EXPLANATION
           I was chosen for jury duty.                       The agent is not known or is not important.

           The criminal was taken to jail.                   The agent is obvious.
           Jury duty is considered a responsibility of every citizen.  The agent is everybody or people in general.
           The court paid me. I was paid at the end of the day.  The emphasis is shifted from the agent to the receiver
                                                             of the action.

           driver distraction.                               we begin with It.
           Accidents are caused by distracted drivers.       The emphasis is on the receiver of the action more than
                                                             on the agent. (In this case, the agent is included in a

               WRITING TIP
               When writing, think carefully about whether the active or passive voice is more appropriate. For example, if you
               choose prompt 1 below, you might use constructions such as:
                   I was told/asked/instructed to . . .
               For prompt 2, you might use constructions such as:

                   The man was sentenced/convicted/released.
               After you complete a writing assignment, read it through and check for uses of the passive. Confirm that each
               passive construction is suitable. If you aren’t sure, try putting the sentence into active voice and see if this makes
               the sentence stronger. Sometimes you may need additional information in order to use the active voice.

                   in prison. (active)

             1.    Many experts believe that giving children an allowance teaches them the value of money.
             2.    Most kids who get an allowance are expected to do several hours a week of chores.

             3.    Warren Buffet plans to leave his children the majority of his wealth.

           THINK ABOUT IT  Discuss the questions with a partner or in a small group.

           1. What is your opinion about giving a child an allowance? Is this common in your culture?
           2.  Reread the quote by Warren Buffet at the end of the article. Why might a person who has a lot of money feel
              like doing nothing? Do you think Warren Buffet is right to have this concern for his kids?

               WRITING TIP
               When writing an introduction, grab the readers’ attention with an interesting piece of information. If you choose
               prompt 1, you can start with some statistics. For example, Did you know that kids in the U.S. earn an average of $67.80
               per month? For prompt 2, one possible way to pull in the reader is with a series of questions directed at a teen. For
               example, Do you need money to upgrade your phone or to get a new pair of sneakers? Engaging openers captivate
               readers and make them want to read more.


              PART 3  Write
              Read the prompts. Choose one and write about it.

              1.  Do you think children should get an allowance from their parents? How much? Does it depend
                 on the child’s age? Should the child have to do chores for the money? Write a few paragraphs
                 explaining your point of view.
              2.  Write a short essay giving advice to teenagers on how to earn and save money.
              PART 4  Edit
              Reread the Summary of Unit 14 and the editing advice. Edit your writing from Part 3.

           CONNECTORS

           Sentences Types


           There are three basic sentences types: simple, compound, and complex.
           Simple sentences usually have one subject and one verb.
                       s          v
                  Students love textbooks.

           Simple sentences can have more than one subject and/or verb.
                     s         s    v
                  Children and adults like pizza.

           Compound sentences are usually made up of two simple sentences (independent clauses) with a connector
           (a coordination conjunction such as and, but, or, yet, so, and for):
                                            coord
                    s    v                   conj  s      v
                  They worked hard all semester, but they did not finish the project.

           Complex sentences have one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. The dependent clause is often
           an adverb clause, which begins with a connector (a subordinating conjunction such as while, although, because, and if):
                      sub
                     conj  dependent clause                   independent clause

                  Although the test was very difficult, all the students received a passing grade.


           Coordinating Conjunctions


           Coordinating conjunctions join two independent clauses to form a compound sentence. Use a comma before a
           coordinating conjunction in a compound sentence.
                                        coord
                    independent clause    conj      independent clause


                  The test was very difficult, but all the students received a passing grade.


           Subordinating Conjunctions


           Subordinating conjunctions introduce a dependent clause in a complex sentence. When a
           dependent clause begins a sentence, use a comma to separate it from the independent clause.

                    dependent clause             independent clause

                  Although the test was very difficult, all the students received a passing grade.

           When a dependent clause comes after an independent clause, no comma is used.

                     independent clause               dependent clause

                  All the students received a passing grade although the test was very difficult.

              Transition words show the relationship between ideas in sentences. A transition followed by a
              comma can begin a sentence.
